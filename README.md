# Habitude — Habit Tracker

Habitude is a habit tracking web application built with **Laravel**, **Blade**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It is the final semester project for the *Object-Oriented Programming 2 (PBO2)* course, with a focus on designing and implementing **database table relationships** using Eloquent ORM.

## Features

- Track daily habits grouped into eight life categories:
  Health & Fitness, Mindfulness, Productivity, Better Sleep, Stay Hydrated, Read More, Social Connections, and Self Care
- Daily progress logging with a numeric value and optional note
- **Mood check-in** for each day (1–5 scale)
- **Daily journal** that can be linked to the day's mood
- Habit reminders with custom time and weekdays
- Tags for flexible habit organization
- Achievements and badges (for example, a 7-day streak)
- Dashboard with today's habits, streaks, and per-category progress

## Database Design

The full schema and every relationship are documented with Mermaid diagrams in
[`docs/database/erd.md`](docs/database/erd.md).

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USERS ||--o| PROFILES : "has one"
    USERS ||--o{ HABITS : owns
    USERS ||--o{ MOOD_ENTRIES : records
    USERS ||--o{ JOURNAL_ENTRIES : writes
    USERS }o--o{ ACHIEVEMENTS : earns
    CATEGORIES ||--o{ HABITS : groups
    HABITS ||--o{ HABIT_LOGS : has
    HABITS ||--o{ REMINDERS : has
    HABITS }o--o{ TAGS : "tagged with"
    MOOD_ENTRIES ||--o| JOURNAL_ENTRIES : "may have"
```

### Relationships Covered

| Type | Example |
|---|---|
| One-to-One | `User` ↔ `Profile`, `MoodEntry` ↔ `JournalEntry` |
| One-to-Many | `User` → `Habit`, `Category` → `Habit`, `Habit` → `HabitLog` |
| Many-to-Many | `Habit` ↔ `Tag` |
| Many-to-Many with pivot data | `User` ↔ `Achievement` (`earned_at`) |
| Has-Many-Through | `User` → `HabitLog` through `Habit` |

## Tech Stack

- PHP 8.3+ and Laravel
- Blade templates
- Tailwind CSS (via Vite)
- MySQL or SQLite
- Laravel MCP for AI-assisted development

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dzakwannajmi/PBO2_LARAVEL_5C.git
cd PBO2_LARAVEL_5C

# Install dependencies
composer install
npm install

# Configure the environment
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Create the schema and seed the categories
php artisan migrate --seed

# Start the development servers
npm run dev
php artisan serve
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>.

## Progress

Phase progress (P01, ...) broken into jobs (J1, J2, ...) with proof, status, and completion dates: [`docs/progress`](docs/progress/P01-database-design.md).
